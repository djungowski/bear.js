Ever wanted to use alert() in an object-oriented way? No?
But now you can!

With bear.js it is as simple as changing a diaper to write your alerts in OOP-style!

Simply download bear.js and include it in your project like this:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="bear.js"></script>

Now you're able to create alerts OOP-style!

    var myAlert = new Alert({
        msg: 'foobear'
    });
    myAlert.show();


Even though it's not used, you need jQuery to run bear.js. You wanna know why? No reason!

Written directly in minified style, you don't even need to run it through any minifyers!
